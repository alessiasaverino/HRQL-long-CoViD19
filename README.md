HRQL long CoViD19
PURPOSE: Health-related quality of life (HRQL) is important for evaluating the impact of a disease in the longer term across the physical and psychological domains of human functioning. The aim of this study is to evaluate the HRQL in CoViD 19 survivors using the short form 36-items questionnaire.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: this is an observational study based on adults discharged home following a CoViD 19-related hospital admission. Baseline demographic and clinical data including the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were collected. The validated Italian version of the 36-item short-form survey (SF-36) was administered at a month following discharge. The SF-36 contains eight scales measuring limitations in physical and social functioning, the impact on roles and activities, fatigue, emotional well-being, pain and general health perception.
RESULTS: 35 patients, mean age 60 year, completed the SF-36 which showed difficulties across the physical and psychological domains, particularly affecting the return to previous roles and activities. Age, illness burden and muscle weakness before discharge appeared to have a role in many of the domains of the HRQL.
CONCLUSIONS: CoViD 19 survivors may need support for resuming their premorbid level of functioning and returning to work.
